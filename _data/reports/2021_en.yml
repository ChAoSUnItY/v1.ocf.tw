        description: OCF was born in 2014, so we’re turning 8 this year! After two years of the pandemic, we’ve got used to working at home and ordering take out, and we’ve got more reliant on technology to maintain our connections to others. The seedlings we planted before the pandemic had already started sprouting, but with the spread of the disease and the urgent need to speed up our digital transformation, we hope that our open source sprouts can continue to grow stronger and more robust.

We’ve worked with these groups：

OCF hopes to promote and create channels of dialogue between government bodies, civil society organizations and tech groups and serve as a bridge between these groups. We hope to connect with groups in Taiwan and around the world and allow them to realise the potential of openness and open source in adressing a range of different issues. We also work to make civil society more aware of the digital tools at their disposal, and allow them to prepare for the increasingly digital future.

Especially since the outbreak of the pandemic and the implementation of anti-pandemic prevention measures, it has become easier for organisations to get hold of personal data, and it is thus more crucial than ever to pay attention to protecting our digital human rights.

    description: I can’t be the only one who knows about all this great stuff! Openness、sharing－－Open Culture is just that simple!<br>In our world of advanced and increasingly common digital technology，whether it be code, information and data, history and culture or even video and images can all be shared and brought together through digital technology. <br>If “open and transparent” can be turned into common practise, then “collaboration and sharing” can become the common basis for activism amongst civil society. If that happens we would be able to break down the divides between different groups of people and help spread knowledge more easily and effectively. <br>In 2021, OCF remained unthreatened by the pandemic. We continued to find ways to reach broader audiences through news articles,  lecture series and educational courses in order to make more people aware that open culture and cultural openness can truly have a positive impact on society.
