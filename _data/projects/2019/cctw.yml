description: Creative Commons 是美國的非營利組織提出的公眾授權條款，台灣稱為「創用 CC」授權條款，是現今網路世代身為一個創作者所不可或缺的開放共享的授權方式。開放文化基金會自 2018 年起，參與 Creative Commons 會員，持續與 CC 組織互動，並協助社群 "CC Taiwan Chapter" 自主發展，繼續深化公眾授權知識的分享與傳播之外，也讓 CC 授權推廣的種子，能接觸更多國內外的自由文化社群。 
description_en: Creative Commons is a global network connecting practitioners who adhere to the free culture ideal and use the various open content licenses. The Creative Commons organization itself is a registered non-profit in the United States. By collaborating with activists worldwide, however, it has developed the Creative Commons License suite to the 4th edition. The licenses have been ported to many jurisdictions and translated into multiple languages. They are widely used. The Creative Commons Licenses were introduced to and localized for Taiwan by a small project-based team in Academia Sinica beginning in 2003. Since then the "Creative Common Taiwan Project" at Academia Sinica has worked with many agencies, organizations, and communities in Taiwan to popularize the CC Licenses.
