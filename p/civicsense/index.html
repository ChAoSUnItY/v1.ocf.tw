  <p>The idea of a “Internet of Things”, or connections between objects (and not between people) has existed for over a decade now, and such systems have been installed in a range of industries. The idea of the “Civic Internet of Things” refers to the installation of internet of things systems by and for citizen groups. These can be used to monitor the maintenance and safety of buildings, to help mitigate the effect of natural disasters, or for use in agriculture (among many other uses). </p>
  <p>OCF is collaborating with groups around the world and Taiwanese businesses to help local communities install and operate open-source environmental sensors. We are sending Taiwanese waterboxes and airboxes to communities and training them on how to install and monitor the devices. These devices will generate open access data to empower communities to understand their local environment and how it is changing over time. </p>
  <p>OCF wants to demonstrate the importance of a civic Internet of Things and encourage more communities to consider installing open-source sensors. Through open source design and development, these devices can be tailored to meet local needs and work according to local infrastructure availability.</p>
  <p>We believe in the power of international collaboration across the private and public sector. We want to encourage Taiwanese enterprises to get involved with civic tech communities and open source development and allow more communities worldwide to have access to low-cost environmental sensors that they are in control of. </p>
  <p>Follow OCF and our partner communities on this project and see how our sensors are being used abroad.</p>
