Project Describtion
</h3>
<p>
g0v.news was established in 2016 as a reaction to the growing global interest in civic tech. In Taiwan, the group “g0v” has grown to become one of the globe’s largest and most active civic tech communities. 
</p>
<p>
TThrough the g0v.news platform, members of the g0v community can have their stories told to a global audience, as well as receive news about the latest trends and developments in civic tech, open data and open government. The g0v.news platform is also the world’s first Mandarin-English bilingual news platform to focus on civic tech.
