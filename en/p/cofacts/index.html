<p>Cofacts has supported open source and open data for years, devoting to combating misinformation/fake news/propaganda via fact-checking and software technique development.
For instance, there is already a Cofact in Thailand which forked Cofacts source code and the chatbot system to help combating Thai misinformation successfully.
