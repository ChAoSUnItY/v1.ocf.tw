<h2 class="ui dividing header">Global Partnership and Collaboration</h2>

<p>
<h3 class="ui header">Goals and Purposes</h3>

<p>Taiwan’s open source and open culture community are very active. Also, Taiwan stands on the front line of democracy battle for long time and has strong civil society. Besides exchanging information, Taiwan can contribute more globally. Through global works, we wish to build a strong open tech community to support our partners in Asia regions. The experiences and methodology could be shared and translated into the global network. In this modern digital world, the world-wide alliance will be more and more important to deal with rapidly transforming threats.<br>Started from 2016, OCF put efforts traveling the world to attend the international conference, also, invite many communities’ members join our abroad visiting. Through the actual attendance, we were able to meet international communities, enhance interaction, built trust, and develop partnership. Not only for OCF’s actions, we also hope to act as a channel to bridge the global and local communities. </p>

<h3 class="ui dividing header">Records & Reports of abroad visiting</h2>
<p> Every time after attending international conference abroad, OCF will release public reports. Many times, OCF will also hold the public sharing after our abroad visiting. All those efforts are for sharing our international experiences as many as possible. For many local communities and their members, it is not easy to flight abroad due to lack of time and funding. Hence, how to still pass our experiences and learnings are important.<br/> Due website revised, the report of 2016-2019 abroad visiting are listed in this hackmd. </p>
