What are we trying to do?
</h3>
<p>
Organizers of large-scale international open source conferences might not cover the costs of transportation and accommodation. These necessary expenses could become a financial burden on young students. Therefore, we provide travel grants for students who are willing to submit their papers to international conferences and share their findings and experience with both global and local open source community.
