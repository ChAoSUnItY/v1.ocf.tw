<h2 class="ui dividing header">Even when a project ends, its legacy continues.</h2>

<p>
This is a home for projects that are no longer being worked on or updated. We want to honor all the hard work and dedication that went into these projects and shine a light on the positive impact they had while they were active. Even though the projects have come to an end, they still have much to teach us.
</p>



<h2 class="ui dividing header"><a href="https://lab.ocf.tw/" target="_blank">OCF Lab</a></h2>
<p>OCF Lab was an information platform focused on the issues of open technology, including open source, open data, open government and digital rights and internet freedom. OCF Lab intended to make these issues more close to the public and bring the positive force of the technology to the society.

<p>The "Openists" was a project that gathered people who were interested in open-source or were open-minded. We provided a series of open source related workshops, and gave stages for people who wanted to share their knowledge and professional skills to the world.</p>

<h2 class="ui dividing header"><a href="https://ocf.tw/p/pttid/" target="_blank">PTT ID Profiling</a></h2>
<p>PTT is still one of the most influential social media platforms in Taiwan. PTT is now facing the same problem as other social media sites: growing amounts of disinformation, media manipulation, fake IDs and cyber army operations. We created a suite of open source tools, open data, and open licensed analyzing reports, which aimed to find out the abnormal behavior from virtual IDs. Using these tools, you can analyze the original data if you don't believe what we found.
