<h3 class="ui header">
Our project goal
</h3>

<p>
Taiwan’s open source and open culture community are very active. There are almost more than ten large-scale international conferences held in Taiwan a year. We would love to see more and more Taiwan-based open source contributors stand on the international stage. In the meantime, we also hope we can bridge the gap between the global and local community. 
</p>
<p>
In 2019, we hope we can foster more cooperations between local communities and international organizations. In this case, many cross-domain projects, such as cooperation between information security experts and human rights activists, can be developed and become the support for the civic tech community. .
