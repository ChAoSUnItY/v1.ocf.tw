Introduction
</h3>

<p>
Taiwan has internationally-acclaimed open source community and active civil society. To connect these two groups, international affairs section of OCF, New School of Democracy, HITCON, and Taiwan Association for Human Rights developed a project named Civil Society Cyber Shield (CSCS) to help social activists reach the latest information security tools, fight against cyber threats, and promote social issues in a safe online environment. 
</p>
<p>
Besides, Taiwan is one of the few highly democratic countries in Asia, so we hope we can foster an international information security support network to provide high-quality training courses for social activists and other high-risk communities in Asia. 
</p>
<p>
In 2017, we hosted an information security and privacy protection workshop for human rights activists in East Asia. 50 participants and various international organizations from over 14 different countries were invited to Taiwan, which facilitates collaborations and training courses in many Southeast Asian countries. 
</p>
<p>
In 2018, we started a training project for those who would like to become information security trainers. Through this project, we hope to nurture information security talents, bridge the communication between citizen groups and IT communities, and foster more international collaborations. We have invited many experts from both Taiwan’s citizen groups and IT communities to join our projects, and we will keep promoting our in-house training and international training projects.
