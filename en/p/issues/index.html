<h2 class="ui dividing header">Goals and Purposes</h2>

<p>
When facing the variety issues concerning technology and society, we know we can’t do it all. However, for those important issues which has less power, to act for advocacy will be critical.
<br> 
<br> Expanding from Open Culture Foundation’s (OCF) 3 purposes: Open Source / Open Data / Open Government, we also put efforts in promoting internet freedom, digital rights, privacy, open authorization etc.
<br>
<br> By conducting campaigns, research articles, information sharing, policy analysis, legislation suggestion, groups collaboration, OCF is bringing up these issues and trying to make changes.
