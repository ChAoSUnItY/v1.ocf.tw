og_title: Joint statement A comprehensive digital transformation strategy is a must for the future development of Ministry of Digital Affairs
og_description: 2022-07-08 <br> After a preparation period of 2 years, the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MoDA) was established in August 2022, with a focus on five key areas: telecommunications, information technology, cyber security, the internet, and broadcasting. In July 2022, Audrey Tang, then chairman of the preparatory group, announced the establishment of six departments and two agencies as the fundamental institutes for MoDA. Undoubtedly, MoDA will lead Taiwan's digital transformation. However, the updated policies, released two weeks before the official launch, lacked clarity and left citizens uncertain about the direction of the ministry. While the current digital development agenda prioritizes economic growth and innovation, it undervalued global "soft powers" like equality, sustainability, democracy, and the rule of law.
