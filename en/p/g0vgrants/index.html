What is Civic Tech
</h3>

<p>
Civic Tech is used to create technology tools that enhance citizen communications and participation in public affairs. With open data, Civic tech can also improve transparency of the government, supervise Congress, and make sure every government official take their responsibilities. For example, the visualization databases of bills that allow media use, the database of company profiles and political contribution, the information of government subsidies. People can easily subscribe to the government policies and bills system, join the platforms for public decision, and even help the community create projects that can attract more civic tech developers. The scope of civic tech is very broad, from internet platforms, online services to applications and web browser plug-ins. The main purpose of Civic Tech is to increase public interest.
