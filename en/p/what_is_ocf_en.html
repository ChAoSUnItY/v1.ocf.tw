<h3 class="ui header">The Origins of Open Source</h3> 
<p>The idea of “Open Culture” originated in the open software movement. In the beginning, due to the dominant business model and closed-mindset of the era, if users encountered bugs or felt dissatisfied with the purchased software, they would have to report the issues to the manufacturer and wait for an update. This slow-paced process stifled the development of software. In response, the free software and open source movements started in the late 1980’s and both advocated for the publishing of  source code to  make software editable by users and thereby encourage a collaborative form of work. These movements caused a big revolution in the tech communities of the time and brought in a new spirit of openness.</p>
<h3 class="ui header">Open Source- Like lego blocks </h3>
<p>There are two schools of open source advocacy: Free Software and Open Source Software. When we refer to Open Source on this website, we are broadly referring to when source code or key documentation is open. We are not specifically referring to the definitions usually given for free or open source software. With regards to the definition of Open Source, we highly recommend the lego-piece video made by Bit Blueprint, which explains the concept in only a few minutes.
