<h3 class="ui header">The Origins of Open Source</h3> 
<p>The idea of “Open Culture” originated in the open software movement. In the beginning, due to the dominant business model and closed-mindset of the era, if users encountered bugs or felt dissatisfied with the purchased software, they would have to report the issues to the manufacturer and wait for an update. This slow-paced process stifled the development of software. In response, the free software and open source movements started in the late 1980’s and both advocated for the publishing of  source code to  make software editable by users and thereby encourage a collaborative form of work. These movements caused a big revolution in the tech communities of the time and brought in a new spirit of openness.</p>
<h3 class="ui header">Open Source- Like lego blocks </h3>
<p>There are two schools of open source advocacy: Free Software and Open Source Software. When we refer to Open Source on this website, we are broadly referring to when source code or key documentation is open. We are not specifically referring to the definitions usually given for free or open source software. With regards to the definition of Open Source, we highly recommend the lego-piece video made by Bit Blueprint, which explains the concept in only a few minutes. Thanks to Jimmy Huang for producing subtitles in Chinese (Traditional).</p>

<h3 class="ui header">The Open Source All Around You</h3>
<p>From large, global softwares like Linux, FireFox, the Android operating system, the BSD operating system of early mac devices, Apache HTTP server, wikipedia down to smaller projects well-known in Taiwan like Hackfolder, jobhelper, legislator voting guide, the mask map. All these are examples of open-source projects. There are open source operating systems, browsers, video management tools and even programming languages! Check them all out <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1654603474718565&usg=AOvVaw1wzrtbWfOrDuBlweZaNE1P" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

<h3 class="ui header">From Open Source to Open Technology </h3>
<p>Building on the core ideas of “openness, transparency and participation” that emerged from open source, new concepts such as “open data” and “open government” have arisen, which carry open source’s core values into industry, civic life, and government. Open Culture Foundation uses the term “Open Technology” to refer to the intersection of open source, open data and open government. By promoting open tech, we hope that openness, transparency and participation can not only be key to how we develop software, but also how we run society.</p>  
<p>We believe that Open technology is the key to protecting our digital human rights and internet freedom. Although there has been more attention paid to both these issues in recent years, such discussion is increasingly focused on regulation of digital technologies and not on their design. Open technology is thus a design philosophy that we believe needs to be in place to build systems that can ensure digital human rights and internet freedom. If we want to live in a world with a free and safe internet, we need to build our technology and our society with the principles of openness. </p>
<p>In short, we believe that everything from hardware circuit board design, and information obtained from people and in the public benefit should be made open, transparent and accessible within reasonable and appropriate boundaries depending on the type of data. This includes government-produced information, medical knowledge, and professional/scientific knowledge in various fields. We want to stop gatekeeping and tear down the walls built around expert knowledge. With public collaboration, we believe we can encourage the rapid development and long-term maintenance of such knowledge.  All of this falls within the framework of Open technology. Open tech and openness exists within all corners of our life, and we can push for more openness across a range of social, technical and political sectors.</p>

<h3 class="ui header">Our 5 Main Areas</h3>
<img src="/p/test/main areas.png" title="核心領域" border="0" width="800">
<p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Open Source:</strong>Using open and collaborative tools so that technology can be accessed and improved by all.
<li> <strong>Open Data:</strong>implementing open data, through using open source licenses to release data directly or indirectly collected by major public and private fields, we can make different data connectable and thus enable greater knowledge sharing and public information.
<li> <strong>Open Government:</strong>using digital technology to help the government use open and collaborative means to promote digital governance and thereby create new potentials for public participation. 
<li> <strong>Internet Freedom:</strong>The internet should not create divisions and should instead be universal. The internet should ensure our freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and through ensuring the internet has an open base, find a balance between the public good and private profit. 
<li> <strong>Digital Rights:</strong> The concept of “digital rights” has two meanings, firstly, our existing human rights (such as the right to privacy) need to exist online, and secondly, new types of rights (such as the right to internet access) that have emerged as digital technologies have become more common, must also be protected.   
</ul>
</p>  
<h3 class="ui header">Open Culture</h3>
<h4 class="ui header">Open, Transparent, participatory</h4>
<p>The Open Culture Foundation was founded to promote Taiwan’s open source communities. The hope was that by encouraging open and shareable source code, we could help to create a trend wherein everyone can modify, contribute and co-work to improve technology collectively. Following the digitalization of society as a whole, this line of thought has continued to extend beyond just coding and now includes all types of social behaviors and systems. We believe that openness can ensure that knowledge and technology will no longer be monopolized by a small number of technical experts of private enterprises. Through openness, we can promote quick growth and sustainable recording of this progress, and it is only through an open culture of this kind that we can exert a positive influence on society in the digital era. </p>  
<p>Building on the spirit of openness and incorporating digital human rights and internet freedom, our style is  “Open, transparent, participatory. When we make decisions relating to making plans or taking action, we consider the (non-exhaustive) list of principles listed below. </p>
<ul>
<li> Rough Consensus and Running Code: As soon as a rough consensus is reached, we encourage people to try things out and not criticize errors.
<li> Patches Welcome：When feedback is needed, we provide concrete and actionable advice
<li> Release early, Release often: all drafts or models prototypes developed during all work processes  should be released early and often  
<li> Open information: As long there are no privacy concerns and there is enough manpower to handle the task, all information should be released openly 
<li> Sharing experience: the results of all our projects should be released openly, and in addition, all experience and knowledge gained throughout the process should also be shared with the outside world 
<li> Implementing openness in our daily lives: within reasonable means, we try to use open source technology and services and avoid monopolization by corporate software 
<li> Respecting diversity: we respect and protect the independence and autonomy of the communities we support  
</ul>

<h3 class="ui header">Why was OCF set up?</h3>

<p>Taiwan’s open source communities have always been very lively. Over the last decade, there have been many new open source conferences held by the community. The financial documentation needed to host a conference had previously been handled by a private enterprise or social organization, but both options come with organizational constraints, so we set up a non-profit.</p>  
<p>In June of 2014, g0v cofounder clkao started the process, and members of the COSCUP、PyCon Taiwan、OSDC communities and the businesses Netivism and Izero all donated funds. With the help of long-term open source advocate pofeng and jimyhuang, as well as bobchao and honki, Open Culture Foundation sent an application to the Department of Cultural Affairs, Taipei City Government. The 10331440100’th letter was sent from the department, and the rest is history!</p>
